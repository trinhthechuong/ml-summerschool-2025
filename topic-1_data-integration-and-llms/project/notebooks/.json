"{\"patient_ID\": \"MM082\", \"disease_type\": \"Multiple Myeloma\", \"recomended_drug_name\": \"Dexamethasone+Bortezomib+Pomalidomide\", \"info_on_recommended_drug\": \"Dexamethasone+Bortezomib+Pomalidomide (Proteasome Inhibitor regime) is predicted to have a positive therapeutic effect for patient MM082. Key considerations include:\\nPositive Indicators (Factors favoring response):\\n- Elevated levels of YY1 (Yin Yang 1) protein.\\n- Higher expression of RHOT2 (Miro2).\\n- Increased levels of EIF4E2.\\n- Higher ALOX5AP (Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein) expression.\\n- Elevated TPP2 (Tripeptidyl Peptidase 2) levels.\\nNegative Indicators (Factors potentially mitigating response):\\n- High levels of MYO1C (Myosin IC).\\n- Increased expression of TAP2 (Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing 2).\\n- Elevated DHODH (Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase).\\n- The presence of IGKV3D-20, a specific immunoglobulin kappa variable gene segment.\", \"decision_making_process\": \"An AI-powered predictive model suggested Dexamethasone+Bortezomib+Pomalidomide as the most suitable option, being the only regimen predicted to have a positive therapeutic effect with 88.6% confidence. Other evaluated drugs (Lenalidomide_Corticosteroid + IMID, Prednisone_Corticosteroid, and Thalidomide_Corticosteroid + IMID) were predicted to have no effect. The model's prediction is primarily driven by the patient's unique proteomic profile, including specific positive and negative indicators.\"}"
