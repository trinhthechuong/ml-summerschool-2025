"{\"patient_ID\": \"MM082\", \"disease_type\": \"Multiple Myeloma\", \"recomended_drug_name\": \"Dexamethasone+Bortezomib+Pomalidomide\", \"info_on_recommended_drug\": \"Dexamethasone+Bortezomib+Pomalidomide is a standard multi-agent regimen for Multiple Myeloma, combining a corticosteroid, a proteasome inhibitor, and an immunomodulatory drug. Positive considerations include predicted efficacy based on the patient's molecular profile, synergistic action targeting multiple pathways, its status as an established regimen with demonstrated clinical benefit, and potential for deep and durable responses. Negative considerations involve a significant risk of side effects such as peripheral neuropathy (Bortezomib), myelosuppression (Pomalidomide), and steroid-related adverse events (Dexamethasone). Close monitoring for hematologic, neurologic, and infectious complications is essential. There is also a potential for acquired resistance, impact on quality of life due to cumulative side effects, and considerations regarding cost and accessibility.\", \"decision_making_process\": \"An AI-powered predictive model indicated that the Dexamethasone+Bortezomib+Pomalidomide regimen is the most promising option for patient MM082, predicting a positive therapeutic effect with an 88.6% probability, while other drugs were predicted to have no effect. The AI model's prediction was strongly influenced by the expression levels of several proteins. High levels of YY1, RHOT2, AFTPH, EIF4E2, UTRN, ALOX5AP, TPP2, AGO1, WASH3P|WASH2P, and TRADD were positive contributors to efficacy. Conversely, elevated levels of MYO1C, TAP2, RNF113A, DHODH, IGKV3D-20, SLC27A3, C2CD2L, PLXDC2, COG4, and U2AF2 were associated with a reduced likelihood of a positive response. These features have established roles in cancer biology, with YY1, EIF4E2, ALOX5AP, AGO1, and TRADD being relevant to MM cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis, while TAP2, DHODH, and U2AF2 relate to immune evasion, metabolism, and aberrant splicing, respectively.\"}"
