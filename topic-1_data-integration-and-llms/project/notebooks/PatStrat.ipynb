      "### Drugs Predicted as no_effect\n",
      "The SHAP features indicate distinct biological processes influencing the \"no_effect\" prediction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Positive SHAP features (supporting \"no_effect\")** are primarily associated with the **regulation of immune responses**, particularly involving T cells (e.g., positive regulation of T cell proliferation and activation, regulation of immune response). Other notable pathways include **cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin**, **posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression**, and **protein-containing complex assembly**. Key genes in these processes include `CD3E`, `IL15`, `ICAM3`, `NUDT21`, and `RBM4B`. These pathways suggest a more controlled or modulated cellular state, potentially contributing to a \"no_effect\" outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negative SHAP features (against \"no_effect\")** are strongly linked to robust **inflammatory and cytotoxic immune responses**. Prominent terms include **neutrophil degranulation**, **neutrophil activation involved in immune response**, **neutrophil mediated immunity**, and **positive regulation of T cell mediated cytotoxicity/immunity**. The **interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway** is also significant. Key genes involved are `CTSZ`, `HLA-B`, `HP`, `SRP14`, `SERPINB6`, and `HLA-DRA`. These pathways indicate a strong, active immune response, which would argue against a \"no_effect\" prediction, suggesting an \"effect\" is likely occurring.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the model predicts \"no_effect\" when pathways related to general immune regulation and cellular maintenance are active, while it predicts an \"effect\" when there is evidence of strong, specific inflammatory and cytotoxic immune responses involving neutrophils and T cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Drugs Predicted as positive_effect\n",
      "The positive SHAP features, supporting a \"positive_effect,\" are primarily associated with the **negative regulation of gene expression**, particularly through **miRNA-mediated mechanisms**. Key processes include mRNA cleavage, miRNA loading onto RISC, and regulation of miRNA-mediated inhibition of translation, involving genes like YY1, AGO1, and EIF4E2. Additionally, pathways related to **lipoxin metabolic processes** (ALOX5AP) and the **establishment of mitochondrion localization** (RHOT2) are highlighted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the negative SHAP features, arguing against a \"positive_effect,\" are strongly linked to **pyrimidine nucleobase and ribonucleotide biosynthetic and metabolic processes**, with DHODH being a prominent gene. Other pathways include the **positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling** (MYO1C), **vesicle fusion with the ERGIC membrane** (TAP2), and **antigen processing and presentation via MHC class I** (TAP2). Regulation of chemokine-mediated signaling pathways (RNF113A) also appears in this category.\n"
