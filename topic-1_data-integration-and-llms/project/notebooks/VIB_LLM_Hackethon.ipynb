      "The AI model's prediction for this regimen is primarily driven by the interplay of several protein features. Key positive contributors include **Prot_YY1** (Yin Yang 1), a transcription factor often overexpressed in Multiple Myeloma (MM) and linked to proliferation and survival, and **Prot_TRADD** (TNFRSF1A Associated Via Death Domain), an adaptor protein involved in TNF signaling pathways relevant to MM cell fate. Conversely, **Prot_MYO1C** (Myosin IC) and **Prot_TAP2** (Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing 2) were identified as the most significant negative features. In the context of MM, dysregulation of YY1 is known to promote myeloma cell growth and drug resistance, making its positive contribution to the prediction for this regimen noteworthy. TAP2 plays a critical role in presenting tumor antigens to the immune system; its downregulation is a recognized immune evasion mechanism in MM, which could potentially limit the efficacy of immunomodulatory drugs like Pomalidomide. Emerging research also suggests MYO1C can contribute to cancer cell migration and drug resistance, aligning with its negative influence on the predicted response. These features highlight specific molecular pathways that may influence the patient's response to this multi-drug regimen.\n",
