      "The SHAP features highlight distinct aspects of immune system regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Positive SHAP features (supporting 'no_effect')** are primarily associated with the **regulation of T cell proliferation and activation**, as well as **cell-cell adhesion**. Key terms include \"regulation of immune response,\" \"positive regulation of T cell proliferation,\" \"positive regulation of T cell activation,\" and \"regulation of cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin.\" Genes such as **CD3E** (a component of the T cell receptor complex) and **IL15** (a cytokine involved in lymphocyte proliferation) are prominent in these pathways, suggesting a role in maintaining or modulating general T cell activity rather than initiating a strong effector response.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Negative SHAP features (against 'no_effect')** point towards more robust and specific immune responses, particularly **neutrophil activation and degranulation**, and **T cell mediated cytotoxicity**, along with **interferon-gamma-mediated signaling**. Terms like \"neutrophil degranulation,\" \"positive regulation of T cell mediated cytotoxicity,\" \"neutrophil mediated immunity,\" and \"interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway\" are strongly represented. Genes such as **HLA-B** and **HLA-DRA** (components of the Major Histocompatibility Complex, crucial for antigen presentation and T cell activation) and **CTSZ** (a lysosomal cysteine protease involved in immune processes) are key players in these pathways, indicating a more active and potentially damaging immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the 'no_effect' prediction is supported by pathways related to general immune regulation and T cell modulation, while it is opposed by pathways indicative of strong, effector-driven immune responses involving neutrophils and cytotoxic T cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Drugs Predicted as positive_effect\n",
      "The positive SHAP features highlight the importance of gene regulation, particularly through microRNA (miRNA) pathways, in supporting the positive effect. Key processes include the negative regulation of gene expression, mRNA cleavage, and miRNA loading onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), with genes like AGO1, EIF4E2, and YY1 being central. Other contributing pathways involve lipoxin metabolic and biosynthetic processes (ALOX5AP), establishment of mitochondrion localization (RHOT2), and death-inducing signaling complex assembly (TRADD).\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, the negative SHAP features, which argue against the positive effect, are associated with processes such as pyrimidine nucleobase and ribonucleotide metabolism (DHODH), positive regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling (MYO1C), vesicle fusion and peptide transport (TAP2), and the regulation of chemokine-mediated signaling pathways (RNF113A). These pathways appear to counteract the observed positive effect.\n"
